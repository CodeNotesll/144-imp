These patterns are called *features,* and one of the parameters of a convolutional layer is the number of features we would like it to learn. **This is the second argument to the constructor is the number of output features.** Here, we're asking our layer to learn 6 features.\n",

Inserting *non-linear* activation functions between layers is what allows a deep learning model to simulate any function, rather than just linear ones.\n",
